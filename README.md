# ipole
Polarized covariant radiative transfer in C.

# Prerequisites

The only prerequisites are the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), and HDF5. Specifically,
the executable ```h5cc``` should be in your ```PATH```.

On Illinois BH cluster, this means loading the modules
```bash
$ module load gnu hdf5
```

On Linux machines, these can be installed to the system with
```bash
$ sudo things
```

The native macOS version of ```clang``` does not support OpenMP parallelization.  So,
on macOS with ```brew```, install
```bash
$ brew install llvm gsl hdf5
```
these should all be binary packages, no compiling should be required.

# Building

Then just build by running

```bash
$ make
```
with or without any of the usual ```make``` options, e.g. ```-j```.  You can 
make ```ipole``` into any destination directory by going there, and then 
specifying the location of the makefile with ```-f```.  Note, though, that
```ipole``` does not support building in directories which contain spaces.

Alternatively, if you are building your own parallel version of HDF5, ensure that
```h5pcc``` is in your path, and run

```bash
$ make CC=h5pcc
```

A particular fluid model or data format can be specified with
```MODEL=model_name```. For all fluid data produced from Illinois codes after
September 2018, the ```iharm``` model should be used -- this is the default if
no model is specified.

The optional argument ```NOTES=``` can be any string containing no spaces.
This string will be "baked-in" to the executable and printed out whenever the
program is run.

# Running

### Parameter files

To facilitate runs over many files with similar parameters,
```ipole``` can read parameter files, specified with
```-par path/to/file.par```.

Parameter files should be lists of key value pairs, one per line.

```
# Example parameter
thetacam 90.0
```

Empty lines and lines beginning with the ```#``` character are ignored.
A complete list of supported parameters for each model can be found in the
```example.par``` file in its directory. Expected keys
that do not appear in the parameter file will be set to a backward-compatible
default value (see ```par.c``` for more information). Unexpected keys are
silently ignored for forward-compatibility.

### Command line

The same parameters can also be specified on the command line by using
double-dash syntax,

```bash
$ ./ipole -par default.par --key1=value1 --key2=value2
```

In all cases, ```ipole``` reads parameters (and parameter files) in the order 
they are specified, overwriting when encountering a repeated parameter name.
Thus for most use cases the parameter file should be specified *first*.

There are two command-line specific flags:

```-unpol```: Only compute unpolarized transfer. This speeds up computation and
is useful for (e.g.) fitting an Munit.

```-quench```: Don't write any files to disk.

These options do not affect the rest of the arguments.

### Tracing

This version of ipole can output a file containing everything it used to compute
a particular pixel.  This includes the coordinate locations of each step along
the geodesic, as well as several scalars at each point (see the
[format doc](https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/docs/wiki/Trace-File-Output-Format)
for specifics).

To activate tracing for a pixel (i,j), measured from the bottom left with i
rightward along the x axis and j upward along y, run ipole with

```bash
$ ./ipole -par parameters.par --trace=1 --trace_i=i --trace_j=j
```

an alternative option ```trace_stride``` is available to trace every N pixels
across the entire image.

# Output

The ipole output format for images is documented
[here](https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/docs/wiki/Image-Format).
Converters are available to translate output into FITS images, or into the old
7-column text format (i,j,F,I,Q,U,V).

The ipole output format for traces is documented
[here](https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/docs/wiki/Trace-File-Output-Format)
